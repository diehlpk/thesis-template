% Ein sehr kleiner Styleguide. Packages werden in Blöcken organisiert.
% Ein Block beginnt mit drei % in einer Zeile, dann % <Blocküberschrift>, dann 
% eine Liste der möglichen Optionen und deren Einstellungen, Gründe und Kommentare
% eine % Zeile in der sonst nichts steht und dann wieder %%% in einer Zeile.
%
% Zwischen zwei Blöcken sind 2 Leerzeilen!
% Zu jedem Paket werden soviele Optionen wie möglich/nötig angegeben
